## For Windows

1. Navigate to the Tor Browser [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download).

2. Download the Windows `.exe` file.

3. (Recommended) Verify the [file's signature](https://support.torproject.org/en/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).

4. When the download is complete, double click the `.exe` file. Complete the installation wizard process.


## For macOS

1. Navigate to the Tor Browser [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download).

2. Download the macOS `.dmg` file.

3. (Recommended) Verify the [file's signature](https://support.torproject.org/en/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).

4. When the download is complete, double click the `.dmg` file. Complete the installation wizard process.


## For GNU/Linux

1. Navigate to the Tor Browser [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download).

2. Download the GNU/Linux `.tar.xz` file.

3. (Recommended) Verify the [file's signature](https://support.torproject.org/en/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).

4. Now follow either the graphical or the command-line method: 

#### Graphical method

* When the download is complete, extract the archive using an archive manager.

* You'll need to tell your GNU/Linux that you want the ability to execute shell scripts.
Navigate to the newly extracted Tor Browser directory.
Right click on `start-tor-browser.desktop`, open Properties or Preferences and change the permission to allow executing file as program.
   Double-click the icon to start up Tor Browser for the first time.

   **Note:** On Ubuntu and some other distros if you try to launch `start-tor-browser.desktop` a text file might open up.
To change this behavior and launch Tor Browser instead, follow this:
* Launch "Files" (GNOME Files/Nautilus)
* Click on Preferences.
* Navigate to the 'Behavior' Tab.
* Select "Run them" or "Ask what to do" under "Executable Text Files".
* If you choose the latter click on "Run" after launching the `start-tor-browser.desktop` file.

#### Command-line method

* When the download is complete, extract the archive with the command `tar -xf [TB archive]`.

* From inside the Tor Browser directory, you can launch Tor Browser by running:

    ‪`./start-tor-browser.desktop`

   **Note:** If this command fails to run, you probably need to make the file executable. From within this directory run: `chmod +x start-tor-browser.desktop`

Some additional flags that can be used with `start-tor-browser.desktop` from the command-line:

| **Flag** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| ‪`--register-app` | To register Tor Browser as a desktop application. |
| ‪`--verbose` | To display Tor and Firefox output in the terminal. |
| ‪`--log [file]` | To record Tor and Firefox output in file (default: tor-browser.log). |
| ‪`--detach` | To detach from terminal and run Tor Browser in the background. |
| ‪`--unregister-app` | To unregister Tor Browser as a desktop application. |
