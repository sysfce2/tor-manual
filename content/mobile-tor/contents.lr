<h3 id="tor-browser-android">Tor Browser for Android</h3>

Tor Browser for Android is the only official mobile browser supported and developed by the Tor Project.
It is like the desktop Tor Browser, but for your Android mobile device.
Some of the prime features of Tor Browser for Android include: reducing tracking across websites, defending against surveillance, resisting browser fingerprinting, and circumventing censorship.

<h3 id="running-tba-first-time">Running Tor Browser Android for the first time</h3>

<h4 id="choose-display-language">Choose Display Language</h4>

When you launch Tor Browser for Android the display language is set to the default language of your system.
Tor Browser is [available in multiple languages](https://support.torproject.org/tbb/tbb-37/).

To choose your display language:

* Tap on 'Settings' (‚öôÔ∏è).
* Tap on 'Language'.
* Select your desired display language.

<h4 id="connect">Connect</h4>

When you run Tor Browser for the first time, you will see the option to connect directly to the Tor network, or to configure Tor Browser for your connection.

![Connect to Tor Browser for Android](/static/images/android-connect.png)

<h5 id="tba-connection-assist">Connection Assist</h5>

If your connection is censored and the direct connection to the Tor network fails, Connection Assist might help.
[Connection Assist](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/connection-assist/) is a feature in Tor Browser for Android that when required will offer to automatically apply the censorship circumvention method which works best in your location.

* Tap on 'Try a bridge'.
* If Connection Assist is unable to determine your location you can select your region from the dropdown options and then tap on 'Try a bridge'.

![Connection Assist for Tor Browser Android](/static/images/tba-connection-assist.png)

<h4 id="configure-censorship-circumvention">Configure to circumvent censorship</h4>

If you are in a region subject to heavy internet censorship and Connection Assist fails to initiate the connection to the Tor network, you will have to follow some additional steps to configure Tor Browser for Android.
When direct access to the Tor network is blocked, Tor can be used with circumvention tools, known as "[pluggable transports](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/pluggable-transports/)", for getting around these blocks.
[obfs4](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/obfs4/), [Snowflake](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/snowflake/) and [meek-azure](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/meek/) are some pluggable transports available to use with Tor Browser for Android. 

* Tap on "Configure Connection" or tap on 'Settings' (‚öôÔ∏è), scroll down to the "Connection" section and tap on "Config Bridge".
* Toggle on "Use a Bridge".
* Choose between `obfs4`, `meek-azure` and `snowflake`.

If you have [obtained bridge addresses](../bridges/) from the Tor Project [bridges website](https://bridges.torproject.org/options), via [Email](mailto:bridges@torproject.org) or via [Telegram](https://t.me/GetBridgesBot):

* Tap on "Provide a Bridge I know".
* Paste the bridge addresses in the input prompt.

<h4 id="orfox">Orfox</h4>

Orfox was first released in 2015 by The Guardian Project, with the aim of giving Android users a way to browse the internet over Tor.
Over the next three years, Orfox continuously improved and became a popular way for people to browse the internet with more privacy than standard browsers, and Orfox was crucial for helping people circumvent censorship and access blocked sites and critical resources.
In 2019, [Orfox was sunsetted](https://blog.torproject.org/orfox-paved-way-tor-browser-android) after the official Tor Browser for Android was released.

<h4 id="orbot">Orbot</h4>

Orbot is a free proxy app that empowers other apps to use the Tor network.
Orbot uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic.
Then you can use it with other apps installed on your mobile device to circumvent censorship and protect against surveillance.
Orbot can be downloaded and installed from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android).
Check out [our Support portal](https://support.torproject.org/tormobile/tormobile-6/) to know if you need both Tor Browser for Android and Orbot or either one.

<h4 id="tor-ios">Tor Browser for iOS</h4>

There is no Tor Browser for iOS.
We recommend an iOS app called **[Onion Browser](https://onionbrowser.com/)**, which is open source, uses Tor routing, and is developed by someone who works closely with the Tor Project.
However, Apple requires browsers on iOS to use something called Webkit, which prevents Onion Browser from having the same privacy protections as Tor Browser.

[Learn more about Onion Browser](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-heart-onion-browser-and-more-ios-tor).
Download Onion Browser from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448).

<h4 id="tor-windows-phone">Tor Browser for Windows Phone</h4>

There is currently no supported method for running Tor on older Windows Phones but in case of the newer Microsoft-branded/promoted phones, same steps on [Tor Browser on Android](#tor-browser-android) can be followed.
