When sending us a support request, feedback or reporting a bug, please include as much information possible:

1. Operating System you are using
2. Tor Browser version
3. Tor Browser Security Level
4. Step by step of how you got to the issue, so we can reproduce it (e.g. I opened the browser, typed a url, clicked on a option in settings, then my browser crashed)
5. A screenshot of the problem
6. Console logs on Tor Browser Desktop (can be opened by Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows/Linux and Cmd+Shift+J on macOS)
7. Tor logs (Settings > Connection > Advanced > View the Tor logs)
8. Region you're connecting to Tor from.
9. Region selected from Connection Assist (if it's a Connection Assist related issue)
10. Is Tor censored in your region?
11. If Tor did connect, how much time did it take to bootstrap? Any effects on browsing speed?

## Tor Forum

We recommend asking for help on the [Tor Forum](https://forum.torproject.org/).
You will need to create a account to submit a new topic.
Please review our [discussion guidelines](https://forum.torproject.org/t/welcome-to-the-tor-project-forum/) and check the existing topics before asking.
At the moment, for the fastest response, please write in English.
If you found a bug, please use [GitLab](https://gitlab.onionize.space/).

## WhatsApp

You can reach our support team with a text message to our WhatsApp number: [+447421000612](https://wa.me/447421000612).
This service is only available for text messages; videos or calls are not supported.

## Signal

You can contact our team by sending a text message to our Signal number, [+17787431312](https://signal.me/#p/+17787431312), or Signal username, `@torsupport.89`.
[Signal](https://signal.org/download/) is a free and privacy-focused messaging app.
Currently, our support channel is available in English and Russian and focuses on helping Tor users in censored regions.
The service is only available for text messages; videos, or calls are not supported.

## Email

Send us an email to [frontdesk@torproject.org](mailto:frontdesk@torproject.org)

In the subject line of your email, please tell us what you're reporting.
The more specific your subject line is (e.g. "Connection failure", "feedback on website", "feedback on Tor Browser, "I need a bridge"), the easier it will be for us to understand and follow up.
Sometimes when we receive emails without subject lines, they're marked as spam and we don't see them.

For the fastest response, please write in English, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Bangla and/or Portuguese if you can.
If none of these languages works for you, please write in any language you feel comfortable with, but keep in mind it will take us a bit longer to answer as we will need help with translation to understand it.

## IRC and Matrix

You can find us in the `#tor` channel on OFTC or [Tor User Support channel](https://matrix.to/#/#tor:matrix.org) on Matrix. We may not respond right away, but we do check the backlog and will get back to you when we can.
