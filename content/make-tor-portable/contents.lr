If preferred, Tor Browser may be made portable by extracting it from its archive directly onto removable media such as a USB stick or SD card.
It is recommended to use writable media so that Tor Browser can be updated as required.


For Windows:

1. Plug in your removable media and format it. Any filesystem type will work.

2. Navigate to the Tor Browser [download page](https://torproject.org/download).

3. Download the Windows `.exe` file and save it directly to your media.

4. (Recommended) Verify the [files signature](https://support.torproject.org/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).

5. When the download is complete, click the `.exe` file and begin the installation process.

6. When the installer asks where to install Tor Browser, select your removable media.


For macOS:

1. Plug in your removable media and format it. You *must* use Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format.

2. Navigate to the Tor Browser [download page](https://torproject.org/download).

3. Download the macOS `.dmg` file and save it directly to your media.

4. (Recommended) Verify the [files signature](https://support.torproject.org/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).

5. When the download is complete, click the `.dmg` file and begin the installation process.

6. When the installer asks where to install Tor Browser, select your removable media.
